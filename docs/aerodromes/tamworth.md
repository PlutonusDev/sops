TW ADC is responsible for the Class D airspace in the TW CTR, as well as the Class C airspace between `A045` and `A065`.

Refer to [Class D Tower Skills](../../controller-skills/classdtwr) for more information.

## Surveillance
TW ADC is permitted to use Surveillance standards for separation. Surveillance coverage can be expected to be not available below `A034` in the TW CTR.  
For simulation purposes, visual separation is assumed to exist below the cloud base, and within 5nm. Visual separation can still be used to separate from aircraft on an instrument approach, below the cloud base.

TW ADC must establish a [Procedural Standard](../../controller-skills/classdtwr/#standards) prior to losing surveillance identification of an aircraft.

!!! caution
    A procedural and/or visual standard **must** be put in place for all aircraft below `A034`.

## Instrument Approaches
Only one aircraft is permitted to conduct an instrument approach at any time, due to limited surveillance coverage. TW ADC must ensure that all aircraft are procedurally separated from any portion of an instrument approach and missed approach that is conducted below `A034`.  

If required, TW ADC can pass amended tracking/level instructions to an aircraft for a missed approach for separation purposes, as long as the aircraft can be issued **uninterrupted climb** to the LSALT/MSA once identified.

## Runway Operations
Runway 12R/30L shall be used for:

- All single-engine VFR arrivals and departures from the 160 Radial through West to the 295 Radial
- Arrivals via DUA
- Departures via GST or GWT
- Single-engine circuit training

Runway 12L/30R shall be used for all other operations.  
`ERSA FAC YSTW`

## Circuits
Circuits are to be flown in the direction coinciding with the Runway designator (Left/Right) at `A024`.

## Coordination
### Departures
A 'next' call is made for all aircraft when they are next to depart. TW ADC must inform ARL/MDE if the aircraft does not depart within **2 minutes** of the next call.

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "Next, QLK5D"  
    <span class="hotline">**ARL** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "QLK5D, Unrestricted"  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **ARL**</span>: "QLK5D"

The Standard Assignable level from TW ADC to ARL/MDE is the lower of `A070` or the `RFL`, any other level must be prior coordinated.

### Arrivals/Overfliers
ARL/MDE will heads-up coordinate all arrivals/overfliers to TW ADC

!!! example
    <span class="hotline">**MDE** -> **TW ADC**</span>: "Via MOR DCT for the VOR-A, FD272”  
    <span class="hotline">**TW ADC** -> **MDE**</span>: "FD272, VOR-A"  

The Standard Assignable level from ARL/MDE to TW ADC is `A080`, any other level must be prior coordinated.
